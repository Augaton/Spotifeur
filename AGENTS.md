# Working in this repository

- Work on the current branch. Do not create branches or worktrees unless asked.
- Before changing the player, read `native-runtime/README.md` and `protocol/07-audio-delivery.md` and `protocol/08-native-engine.md`.
- The client uses the native Android protocols. Do not substitute Spotify for Developers OAuth, the Web API, App Remote, a playback WebView or a dependency on the installed Spotify app.
- The Android client constants in network messages are those of the analysed package. They are not a developer app registration.
- A moving position, the PLAYING state or a full buffer does not prove there is sound. New tests must check the decoded signal past the clear lead-in, after seeks and across track transitions.
- Keep three things apart: contracts checked statically, tests with doubles, and successes against the real services. Do not call full playback working before the encrypted path is validated.
- The engine binaries are produced from the supplied APKM by the `prepareSpotifyRuntime` task, with verified hashes. Never add them to Git.
- The player uses HLS mode 4 and NativeMediaProcessor. `GetMediaHandleId(AUDIO)` needs the full 20-byte file ID (40 hex characters). The 16-byte MP4 KID is only used to find the context. Do not truncate the ID in the request and do not reintroduce MediaCrypto on this path.
- Shuffle reorders the queue inside `SpotifyPlayer`. Media3's own shuffle mode stays off.
- YouTube Music tracks, and Spotify tracks played without a Spotify account, use `ytm://` addresses read by `YouTubeDataSource` (progressive, byte ranges). That path never goes through the Spotify engine, and the Spotify path never falls back to it while signed in.
- Everything in the repository is written in English. The app ships English (default) and French strings.
